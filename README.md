# rsvp
For when your friends are inept.

## Concept
rsvp is meant to simplify headcounts and participation in events.

Take my group of friends for example. We can bicker and argue about what we're doing and when we're doing it. But when it comes to getting a headcount, we struggle. So, the solution was simple. Make them sign up.

## Installing
Clone this repository to any web directory (in my case, `/var/www/hauteclaire.me`) so that your url becomes `https://<YOUR DOMAIN>/rsvp`.  
When you're done or you want to refresh, simply delete the directory and re-clone the repository.
